# GUITAR SCHOOL #

This code was written in 2003 with Notepad. The initial commit is a quick and dirty port from AWT to JavaFX. Much work to be done.

### How can I build and run the latest GuitarSchool? ###
Download and extract the zip. Run 'gradlew build' at the command prompt. There should now be a jar file in build/libs. Run 'java -jar GuitarSchool-xxx.jar' at the command prompt.
